# AccuracyCoin
AccuracyCoin is a large collection of NES accuracy tests on a single NROM cartridge.

This ROM was designed for an NTSC console with an RP2A03G CPU and RP2C02G PPU. Some tests might fail on hardware with a different revision.

This ROM currently has 136 tests. These tests print "PASS" or "FAIL" on screen, and in the event of a failure, this ROM also provides an error code. In addition to those tests, this ROM also has 5 tests labeled "DRAW", which don't actually test for anything; rather, they simply print information on screen.

Here's an example of the menu in this ROM shown on an emulator failing a few tests, passing others, and a few tests on screen haven't been run yet. (The cursor is currently next to the "The Decimal Flag" test.)

# Navigating the menus
Use the D-Pad to move the cursor up or down.  
Pressing A will run the highlighted test.  
Pressing B will mark the highlighted test to be skipped. You can press B again to un-mark the test. This is useful if any tests are crashing the console or emulator and you still want to see the table of results.  
If the cursor is at the top of the page (highlighting the current page index), pressing left and right will scroll to a new page of tests.  
If the cursor is at the top of the page (highlighting the current page index), pressing A will run all tests on the page.  
If the cursor is at the top of the page (highlighting the current page index), pressing B will mark all tests on the page to be skipped.  
If the cursor is at the top of the page (highlighting the current page index), pressing Start will run all tests on the ROM, and then draw a table showing the results of every test.

Examples:

Any test with multiple acceptable passing behaviors will be drawn with a light blue number over it.

# The Debug Menu

After running a test, you can press "Select" to reveal this menu:

![DebugMenu_0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b79c862-1eca-47f4-863d-dc2b89869188)

This menu will print several bytes on screen and can be useful for debugging certain tests in a situation where you don't have a way to view everything in RAM. I suggest simply using some form of memory viewer if possible.

This menu does not apply to every test in the ROM, as many tests don't write anything to RAM, or the values written aren't relevant for what went wrong.

The topmost row will print the values from address $20 to $2F, which are values used in the Unofficial Instruction tests.  
The second row will print the values from $50 to $6F, which are used in a handful of tests.  
The remaining 8 rows will print every byte from address $500 to $5FF, which is typically where a test will store any bytes needed for it.

Here's a color-coded version of that image, with boxes around each byte:

# Error Codes
For more information, I recommend reading the fully commented assembly code for the test.

## Page 1: CPU Behavior

### ROM is not Writable
  1: Writing to ROM should not overwrite the byte in ROM.  

### RAM Mirroring
  1: Reading from a 13-bit mirror of an address in RAM should have the same value as the 11-bit address.

### PC Wraparound
  1: Executing address $FFFF should read addresses $0000 and $0001 as the operands.  

### The Decimal Flag
  1: The 6502 "Binary Coded Decimal" flag should not affect the ADC or SBC instructions on the NES.  
  2: Despite this flag not working, it still gets pushed in a PHP/BRK instruction.  

### The B Flag
  1: The B flag of the 6502 processor flags should be set by PHP.

### APU Register Activation
  1: A series of prerequisite tests failed. CPU and PPU open bus, PPU Read Buffer, DMA + Open Bus, and DMA + $2007 Read.  
  2: There were unexpected extra bits when reading from a controller port that should not have been set.

  6: The OAM DMA should be able to read from the APU registers (and mirrors of them) if $40 is written to $4016, and the CPU Address Bus is in the range of $4000 to $401F.  
  7: Bus conflicts with the APU registers were not properly emulated.  

### Controller Strobing
  1: A value of $02 written to $4016 should not strobe the controllers.  
  2: Any value with bit 0 set written to $4016 should strobe the controllers.  
  3: Controllers should be strobed when the CPU transitions from a "get" cycle to a "put" cycle.  
  4: Controllers should not be strobed when the CPU transitions from a "put" cycle to a "get" cycle.  

### Controller Clocking
  1: Reading $4016 more than 8 times should always result in bit 0 being set to 1.  
  2: Your emulator did not pass the SLO Absolute, X test.  
  3: (NES / AV Famicom only) Double-reading address $4016 should only clock the controller once.  
  4: (NES / AV Famicom only) This double-read should be the same value for both reads.  
  5: (NES / AV Famicom only) The "put"/"halt" cycles of the DMC DMA should be able to clock the controller if the DMA occurs during a read from $4016. The LDA instruction should clock the controller again after the DMC DMA's "get" cycle.  
  6: (NES / AV Famicom only) If the DMC DMA "get" cycle has a bus conflict with $4016, the controller will only get clocked once during LDA $4016 even with the DMC DMA occurring.

### DRAW PPU Reset Flag
  This test attempts to write to the ppu registers before the end of the first VBlank.  
  "No Reset Flag Detected!" will be printed if the write was successful.  
  "Reset Flag Detected!" will be printed if the write was unsuccessful.  

### DRAW CPU RAM
  This test prints uninitialzed RAM values from address $300 through $31F. Some known examples include the following:  
<pre>
F0 F0 0F 0F F0 F0 0F 0F
F0 F0 0F 0F F0 F0 0F 0F
0F 0F F0 F0 0F 0F F0 F0
0F 0F F0 F0 0F 0F F0 F0
</pre>
or  
<pre>
00 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF
00 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF
00 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF
00 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF
</pre>
  Other known patterns include all `00`s or all `FF`s.  

### DRAW CPU Registers
  This test prints uninitialized register contents recorded at power on.  
  Note that there have been consoles known to have noise in some of these bits, and there is no "canonical" power on state for these.  
<pre>
              A 00
              X 00
              Y 00
  Stack Pointer FD
Processor Flags 04
</pre>

### DRAW PPU RAM
  This test prints uninitialzed RAM values from VRAM address $2C00 through $2C1F. Some known examples include the following:  
<pre>
F0 F0 0F 0F F0 F0 0F 0F
F0 F0 0F 0F F0 F0 0F 0F
0F 0F F0 F0 0F 0F F0 F0
0F 0F F0 F0 0F 0F F0 F0
</pre>
or  
<pre>
00 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF
00 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF
00 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF
00 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF
</pre>
  Other known patterns include all `00`s or all `FF`s.  

### DRAW Palette RAM
  This test prints uninitialzed RAM values from Palette RAM, $3F00 through $3F1F.  
  Note that pre-G PPUs are unable to read palette RAM.  
  Additionally, every console tested appears to have a unique and consistent power on state for palette RAM. My console has the following:  
<pre>
00 00 28 00 00 08 00 00
00 01 01 20 00 08 00 02
00 00 00 00 00 02 21 00
00 00 00 00 00 10 00 00
</pre>
  I've ran my test on other consoles, and here are a few other results:  
<pre>
10 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 20 00 00 00 00 00 00
10 20 00 10 00 10 00 00
00 10 10 20 00 10 20 00
</pre>
  While the two result above would suggest it's mostly all zeroes with a few bit flips, I have also seen the following:  
<pre>
20 24 0A 25 34 11 0F 02
00 26 04 25 08 1D 25 12
20 07 02 00 34 22 00 00
00 08 00 00 08 02 03 02
</pre>

## Page 16: PPU Behavior  

### CHR ROM is not Writable
  1: Writes to the PPU Address space from the range $0000 through $1FFF should not overwrite teh CHR data if the cartridge has CHR ROM instead of CHR RAM.  

### PPU Register Mirroring
  1: PPU registers should be mirrored through $3FFF.  

### PPU Register Open Bus
  1: Reading from a write-only register PPU should return the most recently written value to the PPU data bus.  
  2: All PPU Registers should update the PPU data bus when written.  
  3: Bits 0 through 4 when reading from address $2002 should read read the PPU data bus.  
  4: The PPU data bus value should decay before 1 second passes.  

### PPU Read Buffer
  1: Reading from the PPU register at $2007 is not working at all in this emulator.  
  2: Reading address $2007 should increment the "v" register.  
  3: There should be a 1-byte buffer when reading from $2007.  
  4: Reading from CHR ROM should use the buffer.  
  5: Reading from Palette RAM should NOT use the buffer.  
  6: Writing to $2006 does not modify the buffer value.  
  7: The value on the nametable at $2F00 through $2FFF should be put in the buffer when reading from palette RAM at $3F00 through $3FFF.  

### Palette RAM Quirks
  1: This emulator failed the PPU Read Buffer test.  
  2: Palette RAM should be mirrored through $3FFF.  
  3: The backdrop colors for palettes 1, 2, and 3 should not be mirrors of the backdrop color of palette 0.  
  4: The backdrop colors for sprites should be mirrors of the backdrop colors for backgrounds.  
  5: The values read from Palette RAM should only be 6-bit, with the upper 2 bits being PPU open bus.  

### Rendering Flag Behavior
  1: Background shift registers should not be initialized or clocked when rendering is entirely disabled.  
  2: Background shift registers should be initialized and clocked when only rendering sprites.  
  3: Sprite Evaluation should still occur when only rendering the background.  
  
### $2007 Read w/ Rendering
  1: Sprite Zero Hits should be working.  
  2: Reading from $2007 while rendering is enabled should result in a vertical increment of v.  

## Page 17: PPU VBlank Timing

### VBlank Beginning
  1: The PPU Register $2002 VBlank flag was not set at the correct PPU cycle.  

### VBlank End
  1: The PPU Register $2002 VBlank flag was not cleared at the correct PPU cycle.  

### NMI Control
  1: The NMI should not occur when disabled.  
  2: The NMI should occur at VBlank when enabled.  
  3: The NMI should occur when enabled during VBlank, if the VBlank flag is enabled.  
  4: The NMI should not occur when enabled during VBlank, if the VBlank flag is disabled.  
  5: The NMI should not occur a second time if writing $80 to $2000 when the NMI flag is already enabled.  
  6: The NMI should not occur a second time if writing $80 to $2000 when the NMI flag is already enabled, and the NMI flag was enabled going into VBlank.  
  7: The NMI should occur an additional time if you disable and then re-enable the NMI.  
  8: The NMI should occur 2 instructions after the NMI is enabled. (See Interrupt flag latency.)  

### NMI Timing
  1: The NMI did not occur on the correct PPU cycle.  

### NMI Suppression
  1: The NMI did not occur on the correct PPU cycle, or the NMI was not suppressed by a precisely timed read of address $2002.  

### NMI at VBlank End
  1: The NMI could occur too late or was disabled too early.  

### NMI Disabled at VBlank
  1: The NMI could occur too late or was disabled too early.  

## Page 18: Sprite Evaluation

### Sprite Overflow Behavior
  1: Evaluating 9 sprites in a single scanline should set the Sprite Overflow Flag.  
  2: The Sprite Overflow Flag should not be the same thing as the CPU's Overflow flag.  
  3: Evaluating only 8 sprites in a single scanline should not set the Sprite Overflow Flag.  
  4: Sprite evaluation should occur even if only the background is being rendered. This should also set the Sprite Overflow Flag.  

### Sprite 0 Hit Behavior
  1: A Sprite zero hit did not occur.  
  2: Sprite zero hits should not happen if background rendering is disabled.  
  3: Sprite zero hits should not happen if sprite rendering is disabled.  
  4: Sprite zero hits should not happen if both sprites and background Rendering are disabled.  
  5: Sprite zero hits should not happen if sprite zero is completely transparent.  
  6: Sprite zero hits should be able to happen at X=254.  
  7: Sprite zero hits should not be able to happen at X=255.  
  8: Sprite zero hits should not happen if sprite zero is at X=0, and the PPU's 8 pixel mask is enabled (show BG, no sprite).  
  9: Sprite zero hits should not happen if sprite zero is at X=0, and the PPU's 8 pixel mask is enabled (show sprite, no BG).  
  A: Despite the 8 pixel mask, if the sprite has visible pixels beyond the mask the sprite zero hit should occur.  
  B: Sprite zero hits should be able to happen at Y=238.  
  C: Sprite zero hits should not be able to happen at Y>=239  
  D: Your sprites are being rendered one scanline higher than they should be, or your sprite zero hit detection isn't actually checking for "solid pixels" overlapping.  
  E: The sprite zero hit flag was set too early.  

### $2002 Flag Clear Timing
  1: The flags were not cleared on the correct ppu cycle.  

### Suddenly Resize Sprite
  1: Sprite Zero Hits should be working.  
  2: Writing to $2000 to enable 16 pixel tall sprites at the beginning of HBlank should properly allow an otherwise out-of-range 8 pixel tall sprite to extend into the current scanline.  
  3: This does the same thing as error code 2, but writes to $2000 after sprite zero would be prepared in the sprite shift registers. The data should still exist in the shift registers despite it now being out of range.
  4: Writing to $2000 to disable 16 pixel tall sprites at the beginning of HBlank should properly prevent an otherwise in-range 16 pixel tall sprite from extending into the current scanline.  
  5: This does the same thing as error code 4, but writes to $2000 after sprite zero would be determined out-of-range. The data should not exist in the shift registers despite it now being in range.

### Arbitrary Sprite Zero
  1: Sprite 0 should trigger a sprite zero hit. No other sprite should.  
  2: The first processed sprite of a scanline should be treated as "sprite zero".  
  3: Misaligned OAM should be able to trigger a sprite zero hit.  

### Misaligned OAM Behavior
  1: Misaligned OAM should be able to trigger a sprite zero hit.  
  2: Misaligned OAM should stay misaligned until an object's Y position is out of the range of this scanline, at which point the OAM address is incremented by 4 and bitwise ANDed with $FC.  
  3: If Secondary OAM is full when the Y position is out of range, instead of incrementing the OAM Address by 4 and bitwise ANDing with $FC, you should instead only increment the OAM address by 5.  
  4: Misaligned OAM should realign if an object's X position is out of the range of this scanline, at which point the OAM address is incremented by 1 and bitwise ANDed with $FC.  
  5: If Secondary OAM is full when the X position is out of range, instead of incrementing the OAM Address by 1 and bitwise ANDing with $FC, you should instead only increment the OAM address by 5.  
  6: The same as test 4, but the initial OAM address was $02 instead of $01. If you see this error code, you might have a false positive on test 4.  
  7: The same as test 5, but the initial OAM address was $03 instead of $01. If you see this error code, you might have a false positive on test 5.  

### Address $2004 Behavior
  1: Writes to $2004 should update OAM and increment the OAM address by 1.  
  2: Reads from $2004 should give you a value in OAM, but do not increment the OAM address.  
  3: Reads from the attribute bytes should be missing bits 2 through 5.  
  4: Reads from $2004 during PPU cycles 1 to 64 of a visible scanline (with rendering enabled) should always read $FF.  
  5: Reads from $2004 during PPU cycles 1 to 64 of a visible scanline (with rendering disabled) should do a regular read of $2004.  
  6: Writing to $2004 on a visible scanline should increment the OAM address by 4.  
  7: Writing to $2004 on a visible scanline shouldn't write to OAM.  
  8: Reads from $2004 during PPU cycles 65 to 256 of a visible scanline (with rendering enabled) should read from the current OAM address.  
  9: Reads from $2004 during PPU cycles 256 to 320 of a visible scanline (with rendering enabled) should always read $FF.  
  A: Writing to $2004 on a visible scanline should increment the OAM address by 4, and then bitwise AND the OAM address with $FC.  

### OAM Corruption
  1: This emulator failed to sync the CPU to VBlank during a test that ran when the ROM boots.  
  2: OAM Corruption should "corrupt" a row in OAM by copying the 8 values from row 0 to another row.  
  3: This corruption should not occur immediately after disabling rendering.  
  4: This corruption should not occur immediately after re-enabling rendering.  

### INC $4014
  1: The DMC DMA should update the data bus.  
  2: The OAM DMA should use the value of the second write to $4014 as the page number. Requires precise DMC DMA timing, results are tested via a sprite zero hit.  
  3: Only a single OAM DMA should occur despite two writes to $4014.  

## Page 19: PPU Misc.

### Attributes as Tiles
  1: Moving the PPU t register to an attribute table should render the attribute bytes as tile data in scanlines 0 to 15. Results are tested via a sprite zero hit.  
  2: With the t register pointing to an attribute table, scanlines 16 to 239 should be from the same nametable as the attributes.  

### t Register Quirks
  1: Sprite Zero Hits should be working.  
  2: Writing to $2006 should overwrite some of the bits set up by writing to $2005.  
  3: Writes to $2005 and $2006 should use the same "write latch". Tested by performing a single write to $2006 and then writing to $2005.  
  4: Writes to $2005 and $2006 should use the same "write latch". Tested by performing a single write to $2005 and then writing to $2006.  
  5: Writing to $2000 between writes to $2006 should still properly set the "nametable select" bits of the t register.  

### Stale BG Shift Registers
  1: Sprite Zero Hits should be working.  
  2: Sprite Zero hits shouldn't occur if sprite zero isn't overlapping a solid pixel.  
  3: The background shift registers should not be clocked during H-Blank or F-Blank. After re-enabling rendering, a sprite zero hit should be able to occur entirely on stale background shift register data.  
  4: The sprite shifters should treat all sprites X positions as 0 if rendering has already been disabled and remains that way during dot 339.  

### BG Serial In
  1: Sprite zero hits should not occur when the nametable is entirely blank.  
  2: Background shift registers should bring in a 1 into bit 0 when shifted. These can be drawn on screen with carefully timed writes to $2001 to enable/disable rendering to skip reloading the shift registers.  

### Sprites On Scanline 0
  1: Sprites at Y=0 should actually be drawn at Y=1.  
  2: A sprite should be able to be drawn at Y=0 via the pre-render scanline's sprite evaluation with stale secondary OAM data.  
  3: (Composite PPU Only) Consecutive frames should shift the background on scanline 0, causing the sprite zero hit to miss on every other frame. (Tested at X=$80)  
  3: (RGB PPU Only) Sprite zero hits should not occur at X=$00 during this test on an RGB PPU.  
  4: (Composite PPU Only) Consecutive frames should shift the background on scanline 0, causing the sprite zero hit to miss on every other frame. (Tested at X=$00)  

### $2004 Stress Test  
  1: Reading from $2004 (with rendering enabled) on dot 0 should return Secondary_OAM Index 0.  
  2: Reading from $2004 (with rendering enabled) from dots 1 through dots 64 should return #$FF.  
  3: Reading from $2004 (with rendering enabled) from dots 65 through 256 should read from the "OAM Latch" used during OAM Evaluation.  
  4: Reading from $2004 (with rendering enabled) from dots 65 through 256 should read from the "OAM Latch" used during OAM Evaluation. (For sprites that a re in-range on the target scanline.)  
  5: Reading from $2004 (with rendering enabled) from dots 65 through 256 should read from the "OAM Latch" used during OAM Evaluation.  
  6: Reading from $2004 (with rendering enabled) from dots 65 through 256 should read from the "OAM Latch" used during OAM Evaluation. (After the OAM Address loops around.)  
  7: Reading from $2004 (with rendering enabled) from dots 257 through 320 should read from secondary OAM.  
  8: OAM Evaluation should always write to Secondary OAM even when the object is not in range.
  9: Secondary OAM is initialized with all $FFs during dots 1 through 64, so you should read $FF from dots 274 to dots 320
  A: Reading from $2004 (with rendering enabled) from dots 321 through 340 should read from index 0 of secondary OAM.  

## Page 20: CPU Behavior 2

  2: The DMA timing is not accurate enough to test this.  
  3: The immediate addressed instructions should take 2 CPU cycles.

### Implied Dummy Reads
  0: Your emulator did not pass the "SLO Absolute, X" test.  
  1: There were unexpected extra bits when reading from a controller port that should not have been set.  
  2: Your emulator did not implement the frame counter interrupt flag properly.  
  3: Your emulator did not update the data bus when the DMC DMA occured, or your DMA timing is off.  
  4: Your emulator did not correctly emulate open bus behavior. (Or if your emulator crashes here, the cycles of JSR are in the wrong order.)  
  5: ASL A should perform a dummy read on cycle 2. (The PC was incremented after reading the opcode in the previous cycle, so these dummy reads should occur from the new location of the PC.)

  W: RTI should perform a dummy read on cycle 2.  
  X: RTS should perform a dummy read on cycle 2.  
  Y: RTS should perform a dummy read on cycle 6.  

### Branch Dummy Reads
  1: Your emulator does not accurately emulate RAM Mirroring.  
  2: Your emulator does not accurately emulate the PPU Open Bus.  
  3: Your emulator does not accurately emulate reads from address $2004.  
  4: The third CPU cycle of branch instructions should dummy read from the byte following the operand.  
  5: The fourth CPU cycle of branch instructions (if the branch crosses a page boundary) should dummy read from the location of the PC before correcting the high byte.  

### JSR Edge Cases
  1: Your emulator pushed the wrong value for the return address.  
  2: Your emulator has incorrect open bus emulation.  
  3: JSR should leave the value of the second operand on the data bus.  

# Success Codes
Some tests have multiple acceptable behaviors that are tested for in this ROM. The behavior used will either be printed on screen after running the test, or you'll see a "success code" on the all-test table.  

### Unofficial Instructions: SHA, SHS
  1: The Address-Bus-High-Byte-Corruption performed a bitwise AND upon ABH with both X and A.  
  2: The Address-Bus-High-Byte-Corruption performed a bitwise AND upon ABH with only X.   
  3: The Address-Bus-High-Byte-Corruption included a magic number to be bitwise ORed with ABH, or did not occur at all.  

### DMA + $2002 Read
  1: The DMC Load DMA occured after 2 APU cycles. (The common behavior)  
  2: The DMC Load DMA occured after 3 APU cycles. (The uncommon behavior)  

### DMA + $4016 Read
  1: The controller was read the way a US-released NES / AV Famicom should read controllers.  
  2: The controller was read the way a Famicom should read controllers.  

### APU Register Activation
  1: The controllers were not clocked by the bus conflict with the OAM DMA.  
  2: The controllers were clocked by the bus conflict with the OAM DMA.  

### DMC DMA Bus Conflicts
  1: The controller was read the way a US-released NES should read controllers.  
  2: The controller was read the way a Famicom should read controllers.  

### Implicit DMA Abort

  2: The abort behaved the way a pre-mid-1990 CPU would behave.  

### Controller Clocking
  1: The controller was read the way a US-released NES / AV Famicom should read controllers.  
  2: The controller was read the way a Famicom should read controllers.  

### Sprites on Scanline 0
  1: This test was ran on a composite PPU.  
  2: This test was ran on an RGB PPU.  

# Removed Tests
In case you are running an old version of this ROM and are still looking for an explanation of the error codes:

### RMW $2007 Extra Write
  (Removed due to several revision G PPUs failing this test. More research is needed.)  
  1: A Read-Modify-Write instruction to address $2007 should perform an extra write where the low byte of the PPU address written is the result of the Read-Modify-Write instruction.  
  2: This extra write should not occur when "v" is pointing to Palette RAM. (An extra write still might occur, but that's not the one we're testing for.)  
  3: If "v" is pointing to Palette RAM, this extra write should not get written to the nametable.

### CPU Registers Power On State
  (removed due to a recent discovery where many consoles were found to have noise in these registers at power on. The values trend towards zero, but there's occasionally an extra bit set. Notably the zero flag has been seen to be set at power on multiple times.)  
  (This test still exists in the ROM as a "DRAW" test.)  
  1: The A Register should be $00 at power on.  
  2: The X Register should be $00 at power on.  
  3: The Y Register should be $00 at power on.  
  4: The Stack Pointer should be $FD at power on.  
  5: The Interrupt Flag should be set at power on.

### Unofficial Instructions
  (removed because this test no longer needs to exist. I have individual tests for every non-NOP unofficial opcode.)  
  1: Does "SLO Absolute" do vaguely what's expected of it?  
  2: Does "ANC Immediate" do vaguely what's expected of it?  
  3: Does "RLA Absolute" do vaguely what's expected of it?
